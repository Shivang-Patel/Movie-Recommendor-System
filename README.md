## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface to get movie recommendations.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to find similarities between movies.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to include more features and handle larger datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [TMDB Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) from Kaggle. It contains detailed information about movies, including metadata such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecommendersystem.git
   cd movierecommendersystem
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset**:
   Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
   Open and run the `notebook.ipynb` file to train the model and generate recommendations.

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Get recommendations**:
   Select a movie from the dropdown menu and click "Recommend" to get a list of similar movies.
